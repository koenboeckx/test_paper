The goal of this thesis is twofold. Firstly, an algorithmic model of a battlefield is developed. As all models, this one will be a be a big simplification of reality, and I'm fully aware many criticisms about design choices can be made. However, care has been taken to create something that is both useful and exploitable; useful because it captures vital elements of reality; exploitable because it is simple enough to feed it to some state-of-the-art algorithms in the domain of multi-agent learning.\\

A second goal of this thesis is to assess, using this model of the battlefield, whether we can develop strategies using multi-agent algorithms, based on recent developments in deep learning and reinforcement learning.\\

\textbf{Link to research:} establish position of this thesis in the CMI pipeline (with nice sketch from real environment to mathematical battlefield model)\\

In the interest of readability, I've avoided to use any computer code in this thesis (except for the appendices). However, all results are the consequence of a significant coding effort in {\tt Python 3} and {\tt PyTorch}. This code can be found on the thesis' Github page: \url{https://github.com/koenboeckx/VKHO}.

% Write like an Amazonian
% 1. Use less than 30 words per sentence
%   * Due to the fact that -> because

% 2. Replace adjectives with data
%   * we made the performance much faster ->
%       we reduced server side tp90 latency from 10ms to 1ms
