\chapter{Recommendations for Future Work}
\label{ch:future_work}
\begin{itemize}
    \item other approaches than model-free learning (e.g. model learning)
    \item innate knowledge
    \item related: reward shaping
    \item PARALLELIZATION: A3C and parallel simulation of episodes; largest bottleneck: episode generation (not learning)
    \item dependence on hyperparameters $\gamma$ and learning rate
    \item how well work learned strategies against alternative strategies of the opponents -> game theory
\end{itemize}
Hard problem because:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Sparse rewards -> potential solution: reward shaping / innate knowledge
    \item Delayed reward -> temporal credit assignment
    \item Multi-agent setting -> credit assignment among agents
\end{itemize}
